# Game Information
## Car Game 
This game features a small map for you to be able to drive around and collect Stars, plus being able to interact, *(Drive into)* some of the props scattered around the map! This game is the first project of mine using the Unity Engine, it will have some glitches but hopefully will be able to be enjoyed even if for a couple of minutes!
